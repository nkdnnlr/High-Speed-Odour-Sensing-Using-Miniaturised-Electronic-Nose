# High-Speed-Odour-Sensing-Using-Miniaturised-Electronic-Nose

### Introduction
This repository contains code snippets for loading, displaying, and processing (WIP) data that was collected with a high-speed electronic nose. 

### Setup
Install the latest version of Python. In a virtual environment, run the following script:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Load and display data
For loading and displaying the data, run the jupyter notebook [00_display_data.ipynb](https://github.com/nkdnnlr/High-Speed-Odour-Sensing-Using-Miniaturised-Electronic-Nose/blob/main/00_display_data.ipynb).

### Run analysis and produce figures
For running the analysis and producing the figures, run the following jupyter notebooks:
[01_pulse_classification_static.ipynb](https://github.com/nkdnnlr/High-Speed-Odour-Sensing-Using-Miniaturised-Electronic-Nose/blob/main/01_pulse_classification_static.ipynb)
[02_pulse_classification_dynamic.ipynb](https://github.com/nkdnnlr/High-Speed-Odour-Sensing-Using-Miniaturised-Electronic-Nose/blob/main/02_pulse_classification_dynamic.ipynb)
[03_decoding_temporal_structure.ipynb](https://github.com/nkdnnlr/High-Speed-Odour-Sensing-Using-Miniaturised-Electronic-Nose/blob/main/03_decoding_temporal_structure.ipynb)
