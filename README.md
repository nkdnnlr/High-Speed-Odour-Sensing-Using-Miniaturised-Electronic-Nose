# High-Speed-Odour-Sensing-Using-Miniaturised-Electronic-Nose

### Introduction
This repository contains code snippets for loading, displaying, and processing data that was collected with a high-speed electronic nose. 

### Setup
Install the latest version of Python. In a virtual environment, run the following script:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Get data
Download the data located here: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.pg4f4qrxz 

### Load and display data
For loading and displaying the data, run the jupyter notebook [00_display_data.ipynb](https://github.com/nkdnnlr/High-Speed-Odour-Sensing-Using-Miniaturised-Electronic-Nose/blob/main/00_display_data.ipynb).

### Run analysis and produce figures
For running the analysis and producing the figures, run the jupyter notebooks below. Attention: Change the path to where you've downloaded the data to.
